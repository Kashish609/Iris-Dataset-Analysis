# Iris-Dataset-Analysis
This project uses the famous Iris flower dataset to build and test a Logistic Regression model using Python and scikit-learn.


The goal is to predict the species of an iris flower based on its features (like petal and sepal length/width).

The project includes:

Data loading and preprocessing

Correlation heatmap for numeric features

Model training using Logistic Regression

Model testing and accuracy calculation

Confusion matrix visualization using Seaborn
